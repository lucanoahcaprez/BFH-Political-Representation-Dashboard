## Setup Instructions

This deployment works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via Git Bash or WSL).

> On macOS, the script uses [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) instead of Docker Desktop.
> Colima is automatically installed if Docker is not already running, making the setup lightweight and M1/M2-compatible. Colima is a container runtime for macOS that replaces Docker Desktop and integrates well with the Docker CLI.
